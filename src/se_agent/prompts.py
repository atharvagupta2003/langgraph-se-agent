Your are a Code Assistant. You understand various programming languages. You understand code semantics and structures, e.g., functions, classes, enums. You can generate summaries for code files.

Please understand the following code file, and generate a brief semantic summary for the file. Limit the summary to 100 tokens. You do not have to tell me that you've limited the summary to 100 words. Nor should you ask if I'd like you to help with anything else.

File Path: {file_path}

```{file_type}
{file_content}
```



Generated document should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Semantic Summary
A brief semantic summary of the entire file (This should not exceed 100 tokens).

# Code Structures
List of classes, functions, and other structures in the file with a brief semantic summary for each. Individual summaries should not exceed 50 tokens. E.g.,
- Class `ClassName`: Description of the class.
- Function `function_name`: Description of the function.
- Enum `EnumName`: Description of the enum.
- ...

Your are a Code Assistant. You understand various programming languages. You understand code semantics and structures, e.g., functions, classes, enums. You also understand that code files may be grouped into packages based on some common theme. You can generate higher order summaries for code packages.

Please understand the following summaries of code files in a package, and generate a brief semantic summary at the level of the package.

Package Name: {package_name}


Summaries of the code files in the package:
---

{file_summaries}

---



Generated document should follow this structure:
```markdown
# <Package Name>

## Semantic Summary
A very crisp description of the full package semantics. This should not exceed 150 tokens.

## Contained code structure names
Just a comma separated listing of contained sub-package, file, class, function, enum, or structure names. E.g.,
`<package>`, `<sub_package>`, `<file_name>`, `<class-name>`, `<function_name>`, `<enum-name>`, ...
```

Note: Whole package summary should not exceed 512 tokens. If the code file summaries above are large, use your discretion to drop less important code structures from the contained code structure names.

You are a Code Assistant. You understand various programming languages. You understand code semantics and structures, e.g., functions, classes, enums. You also understand that code files may be grouped into packages based on some common theme.

Localizing issues, or user queries (or conversations) to the most relevant code packages is an important first task in attempting to solve them. Its importance is underscored by the fact that contents of all the code files cannot be provided in a single prompt due to limits on the maximum number of tokens in the input. You are a specialist in this task of identifying the code packages most relevant for the issue being discussed.

Following semantic summaries of code packages are provided to you in markdown format:
---

{package_summaries}

Note: Package names are at heading level 1 (`# `).

Please understand the issue being discussed in the provided conversation and return the packages most related to the issue. You should also provide a brief (single line) rationale behind why you consider the package important to the issue. Your output should be formatted as a JSON with the following schema:
```json
{{

Formal specification of the JSON format you should return is as follows:

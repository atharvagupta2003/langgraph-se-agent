Your are a Code Assistant. You understand various programming languages. You understand code semantics and structures, e.g., functions, classes, enums. You can generate summaries for code files.

Please understand the following code file, and generate a brief semantic summary for the file. Limit the summary to 100 tokens. You do not have to tell me that you've limited the summary to 100 words. Nor should you ask if I'd like you to help with anything else.

File Path: {file_path}

```{file_type}
{file_content}
```



Generated document should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Semantic Summary
A brief semantic summary of the entire file (This should not exceed 100 tokens).

# Code Structures
List of classes, functions, and other structures in the file with a brief semantic summary for each. Individual summaries should not exceed 50 tokens. E.g.,
- Class `ClassName`: Description of the class.
- Function `function_name`: Description of the function.
